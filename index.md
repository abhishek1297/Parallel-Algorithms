# Summary

# Introduction
During the recent decade, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has become an important aspect of computation and not just in the field of Gaming. GPU computing is the use of GPUs to accelerate general-purpose tasks which are executed on the CPU. GPU is used when there are applications which use computer-intensive time-consuming operations.  From user-level abstraction, it is simply an application which runs faster with help of parallel processing. This advantage of having a massive number of cores can help make applications more efficient and seamless.

When it comes to Graph, It is one of the most important data structures which can represent real-world scenarios such as Network Graphs in Routing, Flight Networks, Pathfinding for Navigation systems, etc. Evidently, we are talking about millions of vertices that need to pass information back and forth through their links. These large connections will increase the time in the order of vertices. We can see sequential implementations that run on supercomputers perform well, but have very expensive Hardware. Whereas GPUs are much cheaper when compared to these computers. GPUs are highly programming restrictive due to the nature of their hardware.

This project depicts the use of GPGPU to help improve the performance of the Pathfinding algorithms, Breadth-First Search and Single-Source Shortest Path specifically. I will present GPU implementations of these algorithms along with different approaches taken. Experimental results show that up to X times speedup is achieved over its CPU counterpart.	


# Graph Representation
A graph G(V,E)can be represented as an Adjacency Matrix as well as an Adjacency List. Here, I have used an adjacency list due to their efficient use of space O(V+E).  This list  A can be stored contiguously such that there should be two more arrays,  Ewhich holds all the offsets, and, Owhich holds the outdegree for a vertex v which means A[v]to A[v+O[v]]holds all the children. There can be an additional weighted array W  which is stored contiguously as well.
